# GitLab CI/CD Dashboard - Feature Ideas

This document contains potential new features to enhance the dashboard for tracking migration progress, pipeline health, code coverage improvements, and team performance.

## Migration Progress Tracking

1. **Migration Status Indicator**: Add a section that shows which repositories have been migrated vs. which are still pending, with progress bars or completion percentages.

2. **Before/After Comparison**: For migrated projects, display side-by-side metrics comparing the old system's performance (if you have that historical data) to GitLab's performance.

## Pipeline Health & Robustness Metrics

3. **Pipeline Stability Index**: Calculate and display a "stability score" based on factors like:
   - Success rate over time
   - Number of pipeline failures due to infrastructure vs. code issues
   - Mean time between failures

4. **Pipeline Flakiness Detection**: Identify jobs that sometimes pass and sometimes fail with the same code, indicating unstable tests or infrastructure.

5. **Duration Trend Analysis**: Show trends in pipeline duration over time with alerts for significant slowdowns.

6. **Branch Coverage**: Track which branches have CI/CD pipelines and which don't to ensure all active development is covered.

## Code Coverage Improvements

7. **Coverage Trend Charts**: Display line charts showing code coverage percentage over time (daily/weekly/monthly) to visualize improvement.

8. **Coverage Goals**: Allow setting target coverage percentages for each project and display progress towards these goals.

9. **Coverage Gap Analysis**: Identify files or modules with the lowest test coverage to help prioritize where to add tests.

10. **New Code Coverage**: Specifically track coverage for new code vs. legacy code to ensure new development follows best practices.

## Team Performance Metrics

11. **Team Leaderboards**: Show metrics by team or developer to foster friendly competition.

12. **PR Review Time**: Track how long PRs stay open and how quickly they get reviewed and merged.

13. **Build Fix Time**: Measure how quickly failed pipelines get fixed.

## Advanced Features

14. **Custom Alert Thresholds**: Allow teams to set custom thresholds for alerts on pipeline duration, success rates, and coverage.

15. **Job-Level Insights**: Drill down into specific job performance within pipelines to identify bottlenecks.

16. **Infrastructure Cost Analysis**: Track runner minutes used and estimate costs to optimize resource usage.

17. **Technical Debt Dashboard**: Track TODOs, FIXMEs, and deprecated API usage across codebases.

18. **Weekly/Monthly Reports**: Automated report generation with key metrics and improvement suggestions.

## Implementation Priority

To maximize value during migration from Bitbucket + TeamCity to GitLab, consider implementing these features in the following order:

1. Migration Status Indicator (#1)
2. Coverage Trend Charts (#7)
3. Pipeline Stability Index (#3)
4. Coverage Goals (#8)
5. Duration Trend Analysis (#5)

These initial features would provide the most immediate benefit for tracking migration progress and improving code quality during the transition.
